  <h1>Privacy Policy for HouseLearning</h1>
  <p>Last updated: **November 24, 2025**</p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy describes how HouseLearning ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and discloses information when you use our website, services, and products (the "Service"). By using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>

  <hr style="border:0; border-top:1px solid #eee; margin:30px 0;">

  <h2>2. Information We Collect and How We Use It</h2>
  
  <h3>Account and Educational Data (Student/Teacher Dashboard)</h3>
  <p>When you create an account, log in, or use the features of the Service that require identification (such as adaptive practice, saving progress, and utilizing the **Student and Teacher Dashboard**), we collect the following types of Personal Data:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>**Account Registration Information:** Your name, email address, and a securely hashed version of your password. We use this to manage your account, provide secure login, and communicate with you about the Service. **Legal Basis: Contractual Necessity.**</li>
    <li>**Educational/Progress Data:** Information viewed on the **Dashboard**, including lesson completion status, practice problem scores, project submissions, assignments, and any feedback received. This data is essential to provide personalized features like adaptive practice and allow teachers (if applicable) to monitor and support your learning. **Legal Basis: Contractual Necessity.**</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Forum Content and Activity Data</h3>
  <p>When you use the **HouseLearning Community Forum** to post, comment, or start a discussion, we collect and process the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>**User-Generated Content:** The text, images, or other materials you intentionally submit, including posts, comments, and private messages. This content is generally **publicly viewable** on the forum.</li>
    <li>**Activity Data:** Your display name/username, the time and date of your activity, and any metadata associated with your contributions (e.g., the post tag you select).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We use this data to operate the forum, facilitate community interaction, and enforce our usage policies. **Legal Basis: Contractual Necessity and Legitimate Interest.**</p>

  <h3>Feedback Tool Data (Voluntary Submission)</h3>
  <p>We collect data when you voluntarily use the built-in Feedback Sidebar, accessible via the **Alt+S shortcut**, to provide suggestions or report issues:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>**Submission Content:** Text comments, the selected 5-point rating (smiley), and optional screenshots you choose to upload.</li>
    <li>**Technical Metadata:** The time of submission, the URL/page path you were viewing, your browser/device type, and your Anonymous ID (or User ID if logged in) for context.</li>
    <li>**Purpose:** This data is used strictly for improving our Service, fixing bugs, and enhancing the user experience.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Crucial Warning:</strong> While we aim to protect all submitted data, please ensure that you redact or avoid including any Personal Data (such as real names, private student records, or passwords) within the text or images of any voluntary screenshot submissions. **Legal Basis: Legitimate Interest.**</p>

  <h3>Usage Data and Tracking Technologies (Cookies)</h3>
  <p>We primarily collect data through **Cookies** and similar tracking technologies to track the activity on our Service and store certain information. This Usage Data may include information such as your device's Internet Protocol address (IP address), browser type, browser version, the pages of our Service that you visit, the time and date of your visit, and other diagnostic data.</p>
  <p>We use the following types of Cookies:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>**A. Essential (or Necessary) Cookies:** These Cookies are fundamental to provide you with services available through the website and enable you to use some of its features, such as **login session management** for both the main site and the Forum. **Legal Basis: Legitimate Interest.**</li>
    <li>**B. Analytics (or Performance) Cookies:** These Cookies allow us to count visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve the performance of our site. They help us know which pages are the most and least popular and see how visitors move around the site. The information is **aggregated and anonymized**. We use **Google Analytics** for this purpose. **Legal Basis: Consent.** (GA only runs after you consent.)</li>
    <li>**C. Marketing Cookies:** We currently **DO NOT** use Marketing or Targeting cookies. Should this change, we will update this policy and seek your explicit consent before deployment.</li>
  </ul>
  <hr style="border:0; border-top:1px solid #eee; margin:30px 0;">

  <h2>3. Third-Party Services (Google Analytics & GitHub)</h2>
  
  <h3>Google Analytics</h3>
  <p>We use **Google Analytics** to help us understand how the Service is used. This service uses cookies to collect anonymized Usage Data. Google's ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy. You can opt-out of having your activity on the Service available to Google Analytics by installing the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on.</p>
  
  <h3>GitHub and GitHub API</h3>
  <p>Our entire website, including the Forum and Dashboard, is hosted on **GitHub Pages**. As a result, certain data, files, and content are stored on GitHub's servers.</p>
  <p>We also utilize the **GitHub API** to facilitate content management, enable login/authentication for the Forum, and store certain non-database data related to site functionality (e.g., forum posts) in a low-cost manner. Your data stored in connection with this service is subject to the GitHub Privacy Statement. We strive to only use the GitHub API for necessary operational functions that do not require complex, persistent database storage.</p>
  
  <h3>Firebase/Firestore Data Storage</h3>
  <p>We utilize **Google Firebase/Firestore** as a database service specifically for securely storing submissions from our Feedback Tool (ratings, comments, and screenshots) and for managing user rate limits related to this feature. This data is handled according to Google's security standards. We do not store core Educational Data in this specific database, but link feedback submissions to your Anonymous ID or User ID (if logged in) for context.</p>

  <p>We **do not share** Personal Data with third parties for their direct marketing purposes.</p>
  <hr style="border:0; border-top:1px solid #eee; margin:30px 0;">

  <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>We retain data collected via cookies for a maximum of **365 days** or until you withdraw your consent, whichever occurs first. **Account and Educational Data** are retained for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you with the Service. **Forum Content** (posts and comments) is retained indefinitely or until you request its specific deletion. We will delete or anonymize your Personal Data within 90 days after you request account deletion or if your account has been inactive for 3 years.</p>
  <hr style="border:0; border-top:1px solid #eee; margin:30px 0;">

  <h2>5. Your Data Protection Rights (GDPR / CCPA)</h2>
  <p>Depending on your location, you have certain rights regarding your Personal Data. You may exercise these rights by contacting us using the details in the Contact section.</p>
